## Three Distinct Eras of EU Integration

### Era 1: Pre-Lisbon (WP7-16, 1972-2009)

- **Characteristics**: Relatively stable, ~100-140 EU-Vorlagen/year
- **Duration**: 37 years
- **EU Share**: 4-5% of parliamentary activity
- **Context**: European Community → European Union, gradual integration

### Era 2: Lisbon Transformation (WP17, 2009-2013)

- **Characteristics**: Sudden 5x increase in EU legislative activity
- **Trigger**: Lisbon Treaty implementation
- **Impact**: Redefined EU-German legislative relationship
- **New baseline**: 300+ EU-Vorlagen/year

### Era 3: Post-Lisbon Sustained High (WP18-21, 2013-2025)

- **Characteristics**: Maintained at 400-800 EU-Vorlagen/year
- **2020s**: 807/year average (highest ever)
- **EU Share**: Consistently 9-12% of parliamentary work
- **Context**: Brexit, COVID-19, increased EU coordination

---

## Brexit Impact Analysis

**Post-Brexit (2020-2025) vs Pre-Brexit (2013-2016):**

- Pre-Brexit: 877 EU-Vorlagen/year
- Post-Brexit: **991 EU-Vorlagen/year** (+13% increase)

**Interpretation:**

- No decrease in EU influence despite Brexit
- Germany processing more EU legislation without UK veto power
- Enhanced EU coordination among remaining 27 members
- New EU-UK relationship requires additional regulations
