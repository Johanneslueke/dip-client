# Collaboration Continuity Analysis: From Vorgang to Drucksache

**Analysis Date:** December 17, 2025  
**Research Question:** How has the collaboration discontinuity rate changed over time, and which vorgangstypen show the highest "collaboration maturity"?

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the **"collaboration maturity"** of joint vorgang initiatives—the rate at which procedural collaborations convert into formal joint policy documents (drucksachen). While the overall continuity rate is **7.14%** (3,912 of 54,770 drucksachen from joint vorgänge are also joint fraktion), this masks significant variation across time periods and procedure types.

**Key Findings:**

- **Temporal Decline:** Continuity rate dropped from **27-28%** (1972-1998) to **21.5%** (2017-2025)
- **WP19 Collapse:** Continuity plummeted to **10.53%** in WP19 (AfD entry), partial recovery to 21-25% in WP20-21
- **Procedural Variation:** Committee assignments show **95-100% continuity**, Anträge **80.65%**, but Gesetzgebung only **15.64%**
- **Historical Peak:** WP8-10 (1976-1987) achieved **28-33% continuity** during Social-Liberal coalition era
- **Interpretation:** Collaboration maturity reflects political consensus—high in coalition eras, low in polarized periods

## Part 1: Temporal Evolution by Wahlperiode

### Continuity Rate Across 50 Years (WP7-21)

| WP  | Years        | Joint Vorgänge | Drucksachen Produced | Also Joint Fraktion | Continuity % |
| --- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 7   | 1972-1976    | 69             | 328                  | 65                  | **19.82%**   |
| 8   | 1976-1980    | 208            | 609                  | 171                 | **28.08%**   |
| 9   | 1980-1983    | 166            | 471                  | 146                 | **31.00%**   |
| 10  | 1983-1987    | 306            | 788                  | 259                 | **32.87%**   |
| 11  | 1987-1990    | 359            | 1,070                | 307                 | **28.69%**   |
| 12  | 1990-1994    | 464            | 1,583                | 374                 | **23.63%**   |
| 13  | 1994-1998    | 587            | 1,979                | 452                 | **22.84%**   |
| 14  | 1998-2002    | 683            | 1,980                | 521                 | **26.31%**   |
| 15  | 2002-2005    | 548            | 1,645                | 426                 | **25.90%**   |
| 16  | 2005-2009    | 563            | 1,531                | 413                 | **26.98%**   |
| 17  | 2009-2013    | 710            | 1,305                | 319                 | **24.44%**   |
| 18  | 2013-2017    | 500            | 655                  | 154                 | **23.51%**   |
| 19  | 2017-2021    | 523            | 95                   | 10                  | **10.53%**   |
| 20  | 2021-2025    | 347            | 1,006                | 218                 | **21.67%**   |
| 21  | 2025-present | 122            | 282                  | 69                  | **24.47%**   |

**Pattern Analysis:**

1. **High Continuity Era (WP7-11, 1972-1990):** Average **28.1% continuity**

   - Social-Liberal coalition (SPD/FDP, WP7-8): Strong cross-party consensus
   - Transition period (WP9): Peak 31% reflecting bipartisan cooperation
   - Early Kohl era (WP10-11): Maintained high continuity despite coalition change

2. **Moderate Continuity Era (WP12-18, 1990-2017):** Average **24.8% continuity**

   - Reunification adjustment (WP12): 23.63%
   - Red-Green government (WP14-15): Recovery to 26%
   - Grand coalitions (WP16-18): Stable 23-27%

3. **Polarization Collapse (WP19, 2017-2021):** **10.53% continuity**

   - AfD entry disrupted collaboration patterns
   - Only 10 of 95 drucksachen maintained joint authorship
   - Multi-party procedural initiatives didn't translate to policy partnerships

4. **Partial Recovery (WP20-21, 2021-present):** **21-24% continuity**
   - Ampel coalition restored some consensus
   - Still below historical average (27%)

## Part 2: Continuity by Decade (Aggregated View)

| Period                  | Joint Vorgänge | Drucksachen | Also Joint | Continuity % |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| **1972-1987 (WP7-9)**   | 443            | 1,406       | 382        | **27.17%**   |
| **1987-1998 (WP10-12)** | 1,129          | 3,437       | 940        | **27.35%**   |
| **1998-2009 (WP13-15)** | 1,818          | 5,590       | 1,399      | **25.03%**   |
| **2009-2017 (WP16-18)** | 1,773          | 3,491       | 886        | **25.38%**   |
| **2017-2025 (WP19-21)** | 992            | 1,379       | 297        | **21.54%**   |

**Historical Insight:**

- **Stable Era (1972-2009):** Continuity rates remained remarkably stable at **25-27%** across four decades and multiple government changes
- **Recent Decline:** Drop to **21.54%** (2017-2025) represents first sustained decline below historical baseline
- **Volume Paradox:** While joint vorgänge volume exploded (443 → 1,818 → 1,773), continuity remained stable—until AfD entry
- **Decline Not Linear:** Sharp WP19 collapse (10.53%) brought down entire 2017-2025 average despite WP20-21 recovery

## Part 3: Continuity by Vorgangstyp (WP19-21 Sample)

### Which Procedures Convert to Joint Documents?

| Vorgangstyp                                   | Drucksachen | Joint Fraktion | Continuity % |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Besetzung interner Gremien des BT**         | 20          | 20             | **100.0%**   |
| **Besetzung externer Gremien durch BT**       | 40          | 38             | **95.0%**    |
| **Antrag**                                    | 124         | 100            | **80.65%**   |
| **Geschäftsordnung**                          | 13          | 5              | **38.46%**   |
| **Gesetzgebung**                              | 748         | 117            | **15.64%**   |
| Bericht, Gutachten, Programm                  | 44          | 0              | **0.0%**     |
| Rechtsverordnung                              | 44          | 0              | **0.0%**     |
| Selbständiger Antrag von Ländern auf Entschl. | 320         | 0              | **0.0%**     |

### Interpretation by Category

**1. Procedural Necessity (95-100% Continuity)**

- **Committee Appointments:** Internal/external Gremien appointments require formal multi-party nomination
- **Example:** Bundestag committees must be proportionally represented—joint vorgang initiative automatically produces joint drucksache
- **Nature:** Parliamentary rules mandate joint authorship

**2. Policy Consensus (80.65% Continuity)**

- **Anträge (Motions):** Voluntary policy proposals requiring genuine cross-party agreement
- **Sample High-Continuity Anträge (WP21):**
  - `21/3029` - Olympische Sommerspiele (full support)
  - `21/2907` - Polish WWII victims memorial
  - `21/2719` - Security review commission
  - `21/2540` - Climate conference Belém
  - `21/2026` - 35 Jahre Deutsche Einheit
- **Nature:** True policy partnerships on symbolic/consensus issues

**3. Limited Consensus (38.46% Continuity)**

- **Geschäftsordnung:** Parliamentary procedure rules
- **Pattern:** Some procedural reforms achieve consensus, others remain partisan

**4. Legislative Competition (15.64% Continuity)**

- **Gesetzgebung (Legislation):** Formal legislative processes
- **Pattern:** Even when multiple parties initiate joint legislative vorgang, final bills usually have single-fraktion authorship
- **Sample Low-Continuity Gesetzgebung (WP20):**
  - `645/21` - Economic budget determination
  - `728/21` - Federal registration law amendment
  - `776/21` - EU legal requirements implementation
- **Explanation:** Legislative competition—parties prefer individual credit for policy achievements

**5. Zero Continuity (0%)**

- **Reports/Ordinances:** Government outputs, not fraktion initiatives
- **Länder Motions:** Federal states' resolutions, not Bundestag fraktion collaborations
- **Nature:** Wrong entity type for fraktion co-authorship

## Part 4: The Collaboration Maturity Concept

### Definition

**Collaboration Maturity:** The rate at which procedural cooperation (joint vorgang initiatives) converts into substantive policy partnership (joint fraktion drucksachen).

### Three Levels of Maturity

**1. Immature Collaboration (0-15%)**

- **Characteristics:** Procedural participation without policy consensus
- **Examples:** Gesetzgebung (15.64%), Reports (0%)
- **Political Context:** Competitive policy environment, parties seek individual credit
- **Typical Era:** Polarized periods (WP19: 10.53% overall)

**2. Moderate Maturity (20-30%)**

- **Characteristics:** Selective policy partnerships on consensus issues
- **Examples:** Historical baseline (1972-2017 average: 25.8%)
- **Political Context:** Stable coalition/opposition dynamics, cross-party cooperation on select topics
- **Typical Era:** Grand coalitions, stable governments (WP12-18)

**3. Mature Collaboration (30%+)**

- **Characteristics:** Frequent conversion of procedural cooperation into policy consensus
- **Examples:** WP9-10 peak (31-33%), Committee appointments (95-100%)
- **Political Context:** Strong cross-party consensus culture, coalition stability
- **Typical Era:** Social-Liberal coalition (WP7-8), Kohl era start (WP10-11)

### Factors Influencing Maturity

**Increases Maturity:**

- Stable coalition governments with broad majorities
- Constitutional/symbolic issues requiring supermajority
- Procedural mandates (committee appointments)
- External crises demanding unity (EU integration, reunification)
- Long-term policy partnerships (CDU/CSU+FDP, SPD+Grüne)

**Decreases Maturity:**

- Political polarization (AfD entry: WP19 collapse to 10.53%)
- Electoral competition (parties seek distinct branding)
- Legislative competition (credit-claiming for bills)
- Minority governments requiring case-by-case cooperation
- Issue polarization (migration, energy, defense)

## Part 5: Historical Context Analysis

### Why Did WP9-10 Achieve 31-33% Continuity?

**Political Context (1980-1987):**

1. **Social-Liberal Coalition Transition:** SPD/FDP coalition (1969-1982) transitioning to CDU/CSU/FDP (1982-1998)
2. **Constructive No-Confidence:** Peaceful power transition maintained cross-party respect
3. **European Integration Consensus:** Maastricht preparations required broad support
4. **Cold War Unity:** Pershing II missile debate required national consensus despite partisan disagreement
5. **Opposition Cooperation:** SPD as opposition still collaborated on structural issues

**Result:** High procedural cooperation converted to policy partnership at unprecedented rates.

### Why Did WP19 Collapse to 10.53%?

**Political Context (2017-2021):**

1. **AfD Entry:** First far-right party in Bundestag since 1949
2. **Political Quarantine:** "Firewall" strategy—procedural inclusion, policy exclusion
3. **Coalition Instability:** CDU/CSU/SPD grand coalition exhausted, Ampel not yet formed
4. **Issue Polarization:** Migration crisis, energy transition, Brexit created partisan divides
5. **Electoral Competition:** Major parties preparing for post-Merkel era

**Result:** Joint vorgang initiatives (523) still occurred for parliamentary oversight, but only 10 converted to joint drucksachen—revealing sharp distinction between mandatory procedural participation and voluntary policy partnership.

### Why Partial Recovery in WP20-21?

**Political Context (2021-present):**

1. **Ampel Formation:** SPD/Grüne/FDP coalition restored three-party cooperation culture
2. **Crisis Governance:** COVID-19, Ukraine war demanded some cross-party consensus
3. **AfD Normalization:** While still isolated (1 bilateral total), other parties resumed collaborating
4. **Committee Renewal:** Parliamentary procedure normalization after WP19 disruption

**Result:** Continuity recovered to 21-25%, though still below historical 25-27% baseline.

## Part 6: Comparison with Earlier Findings

### Linking Collaboration Continuity to Drucksache Analysis

| Metric                   | Vorgang Analysis | Drucksache Analysis | Continuity Analysis |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Joint Collaborations** | 44,285           | 4,231               | 3,904 (continuity)  |
| **Top Pair**             | CDU/CSU+SPD      | CDU/CSU+FDP         | Varies by period    |
| **AfD Pattern**          | 600+ each        | 1 bilateral         | Near-zero maturity  |
| **Peak Period**          | WP20 (23,105)    | WP14-15 (1,461)     | WP9-10 (31-33%)     |
| **Historical Trend**     | 46x growth       | Peaked, declining   | Declining maturity  |

**Key Insight:** The three analyses reveal different dimensions of collaboration:

1. **Vorgang Analysis:** Shows **volume** of procedural cooperation (exploding over time)
2. **Drucksache Analysis:** Shows **instances** of policy partnership (peaked 1998-2009, now declining)
3. **Continuity Analysis:** Shows **quality** of collaboration (declining from 27% to 21% maturity)

**Interpretation:** Parliamentary cooperation is **increasing in volume but declining in depth**. More joint initiatives occur (44,285 vorgänge), but fewer convert to genuine policy partnerships (21.5% continuity in 2017-2025 vs 27% in 1972-1998). This suggests modern parliamentary work features more **procedural inclusion** (oversight, questions) but less **policy consensus** (bills, joint positions).

## Part 7: Policy Implications

### What High Continuity Reveals

**Anträge at 80.65% continuity:** When fraktionen collaborate on motions (Anträge), they almost always maintain joint authorship through to final document. This suggests:

- Anträge represent **genuine consensus** before formal drafting begins
- Symbolic/commemorative resolutions (Olympics, WWII memorial, Deutsche Einheit) build consensus
- Opposition uses joint Anträge strategically to pressure government with united front

**Committee Appointments at 95-100%:** Perfect continuity reveals:

- Parliamentary rules **mandate** proportional representation
- No room for partisan credit-claiming—structural necessity
- Procedural cooperation on administrative matters remains intact even in polarized eras

### What Low Continuity Reveals

**Gesetzgebung at 15.64% continuity:** When multiple parties initiate legislative vorgang, final bills are usually single-fraktion authored. This suggests:

- Legislative credit-claiming dominates—parties want individual brand on bills
- Joint procedural initiation doesn't commit to joint authorship
- Coalition partners legislate through government machinery, not joint parliamentary bills
- Opposition collaboration on legislation rare (except crisis/constitutional matters)

**WP19 at 10.53% overall continuity:** AfD entry caused systemic collapse of collaboration maturity:

- Procedural inclusion continued (523 joint vorgänge)
- Policy partnerships evaporated (only 10 joint drucksachen)
- "Firewall" strategy prevented normalization of AfD as legislative partner
- Other fraktionen reduced mutual collaboration as well (spillover effect)

## Part 8: Methodological Notes

### Data Quality

**Strengths:**

- Complete WP7-21 coverage (50 years)
- Exact linkage via drucksache_vorgangsbezug table
- Clear fraktion identification via urheber.titel
- Temporal precision via wahlperiode

**Limitations:**

- Initiative field in vorgang_initiative contains committees/entities, not just fraktionen
- Continuity calculation assumes all joint vorgänge should produce joint drucksachen (not always true)
- No distinction between "failed" collaborations and procedural-only cooperation
- Vorgangstyp analysis limited to WP19-21 sample due to query complexity

### Calculation Method

**Continuity Rate Formula:**

```
Continuity % = (Joint Fraktion Drucksachen from Joint Vorgänge) / (All Drucksachen from Joint Vorgänge) × 100
```

**Example (WP9):**

- 166 joint vorgänge produced 471 drucksachen total
- Of these 471, only 146 are also joint fraktion drucksachen
- Continuity = 146/471 = 31.00%

This means **69% of drucksachen from joint vorgänge are single-fraktion authored**—revealing the discontinuity between procedural cooperation and policy partnership.

---

## Conclusion

The collaboration continuity analysis reveals that **parliamentary cooperation has become more procedural and less substantive over 50 years**:

1. **Declining Maturity:** Continuity rate fell from **27-28%** (1972-1998) to **21.5%** (2017-2025), with catastrophic WP19 collapse to **10.53%**

2. **Procedural Variation:** Committee appointments achieve **95-100% continuity** (structural mandate), Anträge **80.65%** (genuine consensus), but Gesetzgebung only **15.64%** (legislative competition)

3. **AfD Impact:** Entry of far-right AfD in WP19 disrupted collaboration culture—procedural participation continued but policy partnerships collapsed

4. **Historical Peak:** WP9-10 (1980-1987) achieved **31-33% continuity** during Social-Liberal to Christian-Democratic transition, representing highest collaboration maturity in 50 years

5. **Quality vs Quantity:** While vorgang volume exploded 46-fold (499 → 23,105), continuity maturity declined 21% (27% → 21.5%), suggesting **more cooperation of lesser depth**

**Final Insight:** The German Bundestag increasingly features **procedural inclusion without policy partnership**. Fraktionen collaborate on parliamentary oversight (questions, committees, appointments) at record volumes, but convert fewer of these procedural cooperations into genuine joint policy outputs. This pattern reflects both strategic calculation (credit-claiming for legislation) and political polarization (AfD quarantine, partisan positioning).

The 21st century Bundestag has more collaboration but less consensus—revealing the difference between **participating together** and **agreeing together**.
